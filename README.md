# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Aim: 
To evaluate how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and instruction-guided) enhance the effectiveness of AI-powered chatbots in handling retail customer queries such as order tracking, product recommendations, complaint resolution, and FAQs.
## Algorithm: 
Customer submits a query.

Detect the intent (e.g., order tracking, product recommendation, complaint, FAQ).

Select the most suitable prompting technique (zero-shot, few-shot, role-based, chain-of-thought, or self-consistency).

Generate a response using the LLM.

Validate the response for accuracy, empathy, and structure.

Deliver the response to the customer.

Log the interaction and customer feedback.

Use feedback for continuous improvement of prompts and chatbot performance.
## Prompt:
Develop a structured scenario-based report titled “Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques” with the objective of designing and testing an AI-powered chatbot for a retail environment that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience. The report should include: (1) Aim – state the purpose of the experiment; (2) Methodology – explain how various prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, role-based, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency) will be applied to design chatbot interactions; (3) Experiment Design – create sample prompts for each technique in the context of retail customer support (e.g., product availability, returns/refunds, order tracking, personalized recommendations); (4) Data Collection – describe how chatbot responses will be recorded and evaluated; (5) Evaluation Metrics – define criteria such as accuracy, clarity, helpfulness, personalization, and user satisfaction; (6) Analysis – compare the performance of each prompting technique, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness in customer interaction; (7) Results – tabulate findings to show performance differences; (8) Conclusion and Recommendations – summarize insights, identify the best-performing prompting techniques for retail chatbot applications, and suggest best practices for future development. Ensure the report is well-structured, analytical, and uses clear headings, bullet points, and tables where necessary.

## Result:
The evaluation of diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and instruction-guided) for handling retail customer queries such as order tracking, product recommendations, complaint resolution, and FAQs was executed successfully. The experiment demonstrated that each prompting technique has unique strengths in different scenarios, and the chatbot’s overall effectiveness improved when appropriate prompting strategies were applied.
